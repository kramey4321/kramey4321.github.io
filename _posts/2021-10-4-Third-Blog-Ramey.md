[ST558 Project 1: All Things Pokemon](https://kramey4321.github.io/ST558proj1/)

For this project, I created a vignette that pulls data from the Pokémon API that created user friendly functions and data analysis.  I am addicted to the Pokémon GO app and loved being able to tie my passion into my project.  

It was interesting to peak behind the curtain and see numerically why a pidgey is so much easier to catch than a palkia.  All players of Pokemon Go have experienced firsthand the pains of a pokemon escaping capture and know before they throw that first ball whether this will be a nail-biter experience, but it was very satisfying to see how they use capture rates to quantify this interaction.    

I didn’t grow up watching or playing Pokemon video games nor the card game, so I didn’t realize how much information is out there.  I didn’t know Pokemon had base happiness levels.  While playing Pokemon Go, I noticed that for certain pokemon, I would never seem to get a certain gender, the game makers use a ‘gender rate’ to program this phenomenon.  

The amount of data that is in the API is a double edge sword.  It gave me a lot of options, but the choices started to get overwhelming.  Especially since the data gives a ton of stats, but only one set for each pokemon.  I ended up having to group Pokemon and Berries in a lot of creative ways to be able to do summary statistics and graphs.  
One of the most difficult part of this epic project was that I kept losing the big picture.  I had the unfortunate habit of zeroing in on the two variables I wanted to use, so instead of grabbing a bunch of data all at once, I piece-milled my calls.  I finally corrected myself and it made the data analysis much easier to code.  If I was doing this again, I think I would create a diagram of all the different functions I wanted to create and map out what variables I needed.  

Another hurdle was the added challenges of using Git Hub.  My step zero of just pulling the right repo into Markdown did not set me on a smooth journey.  And my final step, of creating the render function as an R script, (I’m assuming I will ultimately be successful, but its 36 hours until its due, and its not working right now…) is so frustrating.  With all the other components of this project, I wish we could just submit our Markdown file and a HTML.  

Ultimately, I would say the most difficult part of this entire project was my lack of confidence in my ability to program.  I would never have thought I could produce anything at this level.  It was a painful evolution, but I am very, very proud of my accomplishments…just hope I can get it to render. Ha!
