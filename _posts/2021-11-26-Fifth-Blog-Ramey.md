title: A Retrospect of ST558
---

As my journey through ST558 comes to an end, I'll take a moment to reflect on the path I have taken...or rather my evolution.  My knowledge of a 'data scientist' has morphed along these past months.  After reading the articles at the start of the term, I felt woefully unqualified to ever try my hand as a DS because of my limited programming knowledge.  But this course has given me confidence...a TON of headaches...but confidence in my ability.  And I realize that it is okay that my programs may take twenty times as long as my classmates who program in their profession - I learned sortly after the second homework to not let suggested time allotment mock me. It's okay that my code might not be the most effiencent.  When I look at my finished projects, I am just in awe that it is something I created (albeit with a lot of help).  And I realized as the course went on, things got easier with practice.  The new part of the assignment was an uphill challenge, but the parts that tapped into previous material was comfortably familiar.  For example, with the shiny app homework, getting the ui and server to allign was eye blurring, but writing the code to graph was comforting.

I think R, with its open source and wealth of resources, is an insanely good vechile for data science.  Now, I say this with only SAS as a reference, but I am seeing the clean dimensional approach to R's structure and it makes sense...not at first, but once the error messages clear up, I can appreciate the methodology the language uses.  I definitely will continue to bring R into my classroom.  I want students to get exposure and learn some R skills so that they can start out ten steps ahead of me when I started this Master's program.  I feel it is my way to pay if forward.

As I mentioned earlier, after this course, I am going to continually push me and my students to dive into R.  I am also going to continually implore my favorite professor to stay in touch and continue to mentor me and share his talents with my students.
