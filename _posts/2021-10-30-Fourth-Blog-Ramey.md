### What would you do differently?
Get a different partner....HAHAHAHA!  j/k  Craig is the BEST and I am so glad to be doing this project, this program, and this life with him.

As far as doing things differently, I would try to research more before starting the EDA.  It wasn't until office hours that I realized that 
'polarized' was a function in R.  I was interpreting the word as a layman and thinking it was 'Polarized Viewpoints'.  

When we got to the modeling component, I wish I discussed my findings during office hours sooner.  I was bummed at my values and another group 
suggested using the log of the responses in order to scale down the response.  This was the perfect solution since some of the shares were off the
charts (you know it had to be an article about cats).

#### What was the most difficult part for you?
I lucked out and was 'Player 2'.  Craig had a beast of a time getting the Random Forest model to run.  Figuring out how to tune the Boosted Tree took
some finagling, but I had immediate feedback on my code.  Compiling the Random Forest took ages and required parallel processing. I had enough trouble
getting my EDA graphs and models summaries to print. 

The other difficult part was syncing our uploads.  You would think two people who work in the same hallway would not have conflicts uploading, but you 
would be wrong.  I think we were too 'loosey-goosey' with our syncing and did not create a definitive schedule to avoid issues.  

### What are your big take-aways from this project?
I CAN DO ANYTHING!!!...with Craig's help.  

Also, I am appreciating more and more what programming can do.  The 'labor pains' of navigating Markdown, of learning R packages (such as caret, gbm, etc),
and of creating automations all are worth it once you realize how streamline and professional your analysis can become.
